  "text": "Washington (AFP) – US President Donald Trump has decided to push back his decision on whether to impose controversial tariffs on steel and aluminum from the European Union until June 1, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing a senior administration official. \nThe report came just hours before tariff exemptions were due to expire at midnight for the EU, Canada, Mexico and others, after which the major exporters would face punishing import duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. \nThe postponement would effectively leave the exemptions in place. \nTrump announced the tariffs on March 8, but exempted the European Union later that month. \nThe Trump administration has justified the tariffs — aimed primarily at Chinese overproduction — on national security grounds and told trading partners they must make concessions to win permanent exemptions. \nThe EU has insisted it will not negotiate without first obtaining a permanent exemption. \nThe US official, speaking to the Journal on condition of anonymity, also said that the Trump administration would announce later Monday it had reached a deal to exempt South Korea from the tariffs. \nTrump is working with South Korean President Moon Jae-in ahead of the US leader's expected summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks. \nLast month, the government in Seoul said it had made concessions to secure a revised trade deal with Washington and escape its steel duties. \nExtensions for Canada and Mexico had been expected, as Washington, Mexico City and Ottawa work on revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement.",
